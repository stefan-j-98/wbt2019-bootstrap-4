In short, wherever help is needed for making webpages that will look pretty and function as good, no mind if it were on a PC, tablet, or a smartphone, Bootstrap will make your job easier.",
    "welcome-text-3": "Bootstrap is free and open-source framework for rapid development of responsive webpages, which greatly simplifies the process of building with its frequently-used functionality and design presets, that are otherwise hard to code without Bootstrap. Because of that, Bootstrap is widely used, not only by beginners, but also by big companies, that want the long-lasting reliability of Bootstrap, which is confirmed by years of use in industry and a plethora of pages that have it included.",

    "bs4-title-1": "How Bootstrap came about?",
    "bs4-text-1": "Bootstrap wasn’t, from it’s beginning, the framework that is now used all over the internet.",
    "bs4-text-2": "First known as Twitter Blueprint, Bootstrap was initially conceived as a internal side project of Twitter’s programmers, who wanted it to improve Twitter itself, by replacing the previously used libraries, that weren’t up to standards. They were corrupting the internal structure and induced a load of maintenance burden upon the developers. Even though a new framework wasn’t planned per se, spontaneusly, as this side project progressed, a new product emerged, soon to become available to general programming audience, on April the 19th, 2011.",
    "bs4-versions-title": "Versions",
    "bs4-versions-text-1": "After the initial release, when it became clear that Bootstrap overcame the excpectations and the scope of Twitter, the development team soon shifted to active work and maintenance, as a separate project on its own.",
    "bs4-versions-text-2": "With version 2.0, Bootstrap added a typography support, in form of Glyphicons, and several other components. However, the basis for the future development of Bootstrap, as well as what Bootstrap pioneered and is known for, came about in this release. The responsive design was added as an optional functionality, that wasn’t forced as mandatory, but nevertheless became the defining characteristic of Bootstrap for that and future versions.",
    "bs4-versions-text-3": "In version 3, in April 2013, the project made a shift to a minimalistic design, the responsiveness was made the default option, and as such, new, mobile-first approach was taken in designing the usage of Bootstrap.",
    "bs4-versions-text-4": "With version 4, january 2018, a large change ensued in the internal structure and code inside of Bootstrap. Preprocessor language for compiling CSS was changed from Less to Sass, em was made default measuring unit instead of pixels, Glyphicon support was dropped, and the greatest change was a shift to CSS Flexbox layout, which further increased the flexibility and ease of use.",
    "bs4-usage-title": "Where is Bootstrap used?",
    "bs4-usage-text-1": "Mainly for its ease of use, but high successes, Bootstrap surged through to the top in relatively short time among the rest of the frontend frameworks. Besides, Bootstrap’s GitHub repo is second-most starred repo, just after freeCodeCamp repo.",
    "bs4-usage-text-2": "Also, according to data for 2018, Bootstrap was featured on about 18% among one million of top-rated sites, or about 17% among the first ten thousand sites.",
